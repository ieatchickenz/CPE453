READING ....
3.7.4 pages 285-293
Hard disk driver in Minix. Helpful, but, mercifully, not terribly important for this task.


5.3   pages 489-515
Filesystem implementation.


5.6   pages 538-556    in particular 5.6.4
The minix filesystem. Quite important.



Figure 5-36 the minix inode structure



MBR is different from Boot block in the manner that a Master boot block is the
only one located at the very front of the "disk"
MBR and BOOT BLOCK are both 1024
MBR hold four slots of size ??? at very end to specify partitions
